//! AppImage environment hygiene for child processes.
//
// The AppImage runtime points `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at the bundle's own lib
// directory, and every process Tervia spawns inherits it. A system program then
// resolves its dependencies against OUR libraries instead of the distribution's,
// which fails as an undefined symbol rather than as anything naming the cause:
// PHP loading `curl.so` against a bundled `libcurl.so.4` is the reported case,
// and `git` over https is the same trap.
//
// So: when running as an AppImage, strip the variable from anything we launch
// that is not us. Deliberately NOT applied where the child IS Tervia (the PTY
// daemon, the updater), which needs the bundled libraries to load at all.
//
// The `APPIMAGE` variable is set by the AppImage runtime itself, so its presence
// is the signal; outside one there is nothing to strip and this is a no-op.
