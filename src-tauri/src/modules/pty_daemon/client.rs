// Daemon client — lives inside the GUI process. Maintains one persistent
// connection to the sidecar daemon (spawning it if necessary), translates
// the GUI's sync per-session API into IPC requests, and routes push
// events (`Data` / `Exit`) onto the Tauri `Channel<PtyEvent>` the
// frontend installed via `pty_open`.
//
// Concurrency:
//   • ONE shared `Arc<Stream>` for the socket. The sync `interprocess`
//     stream impls `Read`/`Write` on `&Stream` (interior mutability over
//     the OS handle), so the reader thread and the writer can each hold
//     `&Stream` concurrently — no Mutex on the stream itself.
//   • `write_lock` serializes the producer side so frames are not
//     interleaved across concurrent Tauri command handlers.
//   • `pending` holds one `SyncSender<DaemonMsg>` per in-flight request,
//     keyed by `ReqId`. The reader thread fulfills them on response.
//   • `sessions` routes push events to per-session `Channel<PtyEvent>`.
//
// Lifecycle:
//   • `connect_or_spawn()`: try connect → if fail, spawn detached daemon
//     → retry connect with exponential backoff (5 s budget).
//   • If the reader hits an error the connection is considered dead; we
//     mark `alive=false` and let subsequent requests error out. The GUI
//     can fall back to in-process spawn (see `pty/mod.rs` settings flag).
