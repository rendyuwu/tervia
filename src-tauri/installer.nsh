; Tauri NSIS hooks for the `tedi` CLI launcher + user-data safety net.
;
; Binary layout in $INSTDIR after install:
;   TEDIApp.exe   GUI subsystem — the actual app. Named so PATHEXT does NOT
;                 resolve `tedi` to it; the user-facing entry point is the
;                 console stub below.
;   tedi.exe      console subsystem — built from tedi-cli/src/main.rs. This is
;                 what PowerShell / cmd invoke when the user types `tedi`.
;                 Dispatches `--help` / `--version` inline, runs `--update`
;                 synchronously with inherited stdio, detaches
;                 GUI launches. Fixes the long-standing PowerShell-doesn't-
;                 wait-for-GUI ordering bug where `tedi --help` printed
;                 below the next prompt and left the cursor garbled.
;
; On install:
;   * Snapshot the user's app-data dir (history, settings, sessions, ...)
;     to %TEMP% before the rest of the installer (or the
;     previous uninstaller, which auto-update invokes in passive mode) gets
;     a chance to touch it. PREINSTALL runs before any file deletion.
;   * Drop `tedi.exe` (console stub) next to `TEDIApp.exe` via NSIS File
;     directive. Path is relative to the generated installer.nsi at
;     `<src-tauri>/target/release/bundle/nsis/<lang>/`.
;   * Sweep any legacy `tedi.cmd` shim from older installs (<=0.2.19); the
;     console stub replaces it entirely.
;   * Append the install dir to the user's PATH (HKCU\Environment) if not
;     already present, then broadcast WM_SETTINGCHANGE so freshly-spawned
;     shells pick it up without a logout. Through PowerShell, not NSIS
;     registry instructions - NSIS cannot hold a PATH longer than 1024
;     characters and mangles it on the way through.
;   * Restore the user-data snapshot when key files vanished during the
;     install. Belt-and-suspenders against Tauri NSIS template variants
;     that wipe app data on upgrade.
;
; On uninstall we delete both binaries-as-data we wrote (`tedi.exe`,
; `tedi.cmd` for legacy installs) but deliberately leave the PATH entry
; alone: a stale entry to a non-existent dir is harmless (Windows skips it
; during PATH lookup), while every write to that value is a chance to corrupt
; the user's PATH, and auto-update runs the old uninstaller mid-flight.

; through PowerShell rather than NSIS registry instructions - see the block in

; --- "Open with TEDI" shell verbs -----------------------------------------
; Explorer builds a context menu from static verbs under
; <root>\shell\<verb>, so registering under HKCU\Software\Classes gives the
; whole thing without an elevated installer (installMode is currentUser).
; Four roots, because Explorer treats them as unrelated:
;   Directory             right-click ON a folder
;   Directory\Background  right-click on empty space INSIDE a folder
;   Drive                 right-click on a drive root (C:\, D:\, ...)
;   *                     right-click on any file
;
; `%V` is the folder the menu was raised on and is the only field code the
; Background root understands; `*` has no `%V`, so files use `%1`.
;
; The command points at TEDIApp.exe, NOT the tedi.exe console stub: the stub
; is console-subsystem and would flash a console window on every click.
; TEDIApp.exe already resolves a positional path via `cli::capture_startup`
; and forwards it to a running instance through single-instance, so one click
; either boots TEDI at that path or opens a tab in the window already up.
;
; Windows 11 note: these are classic verbs, so they appear under
; "Show more options" (Shift+F10) rather than the trimmed default menu.
; Top-level placement needs an IExplorerCommand COM handler shipped from a
; packaged (MSIX/sparse) app - the same limitation VS Code's "Open with Code"
; lives with.
!define TEDI_VERB "TEDI"

; --- "Open with" app-picker entry -----------------------------------------
; Separate mechanism from the shell verbs above, and easy to conflate: the
; verbs put a top-level "Open with TEDI" line on the menu, while Explorer
; builds the "Open with >" submenu from apps registered under
; Software\Classes\Applications\<exe>. Registering only the verbs (as we did
; through 0.3.97) means TEDI is absent from that submenu even though its own
; line is right there on the same menu.
;
; A shell\open\command is the whole registration - this is what VS Code
; ships and nothing more. No SupportedTypes (the app opens anything) and no
; FriendlyAppName: Explorer falls back to the exe's FileDescription, which
; the Tauri bundler already stamps as "TEDI".
!define TEDI_APP_KEY "Software\Classes\Applications\TEDIApp.exe"

; somehow skipped — never accumulates stale snapshots.

!macro NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL
  ; --- install tedi.exe (console-subsystem launcher) -----------------------
  ; TEDIApp.exe is `windows_subsystem = "windows"`; PowerShell does not
  ; synchronously wait for GUI-subsystem children, so `tedi --help` output
  ; lands after the next prompt and the cursor ends up mid-line. tedi.exe
  ; is a console-subsystem twin from tedi-cli/src/main.rs that PowerShell
  ; waits for properly. PATHEXT then resolves the user's `tedi` to this
  ; binary instead of the GUI (the GUI is renamed TEDIApp.exe specifically
  ; to keep it off PATHEXT's `tedi.exe` lookup).
  ;
  ; The release workflow builds the stub via an explicit
  ; `cargo build --release -p tedi-cli` step (see
  ; .github/workflows/release.yml), so by the time NSIS runs the file is at
  ; <src-tauri>/target/release/tedi.exe. The Tauri 2.11 NSIS bundler emits
  ; `installer.nsi` at `<src-tauri>/target/release/bundle/nsis/installer.nsi`
  ; (NO per-language subdirectory — earlier versions of this comment claimed
  ; otherwise and shipped `..\..\..\tedi.exe`, which resolved one level too
  ; high to `target/tedi.exe`. `/nonfatal` then swallowed the missing-file
  ; error and the installer silently shipped without the launcher, leaving
  ; the user with "'tedi' is not recognized as an internal or external
  ; command"). Two dots up = bundle/, three dots = the bundle/nsis sibling
  ; level we don't want, two dots is correct: `..\..\` lands at
  ; target/release/.
  ;
  ; Drop /nonfatal so a missing tedi.exe FAILS the installer build instead
  ; of producing a broken installer. The launcher is now load-bearing for
  ; every CLI subcommand (`tedi --help`, `tedi ext ...`, etc.) so a missing
  ; binary is not a degradation — it is a complete CLI outage.
  SetOutPath "$INSTDIR"
  File "/oname=tedi.exe" "..\..\tedi.exe"

  ; --- remove any legacy tedi.cmd shim ------------------------------------
  ; v0.2.0 .. v0.2.19 wrote a `tedi.cmd` here that handled --help / --version
  ; natively and delegated other subcommands to TEDI.exe. The new tedi.exe
  ; supersedes it — leave nothing on disk that could confuse PATHEXT (cmd
  ; runs AFTER exe so it would be a no-op, but keep things tidy).
  Delete "$INSTDIR\tedi.cmd"

  ; --- ensure install dir is on user PATH ---------------------------------
  ; NEVER read PATH with ReadRegStr. NSIS_MAX_STRLEN is 1024, and on a longer
  ; value ReadRegStr does not return a truncated string - it returns an EMPTY
  ; one plus the error flag. The old code read that as "user has no PATH yet"
  ; and wrote `Path = $INSTDIR`, destroying every entry the user had. Measured
  ; against the NSIS 3.08 the Tauri bundler ships: a 1023-char PATH reads fine,
  ; 1024 comes back empty, and a 1573-char one came back out as 32 chars of
  ; install dir. Any dev machine clears that easily. Issue #9. Just under the
  ; limit the concatenation truncated instead, appending half a directory as a
  ; junk PATH entry. Both failure modes are silent.
  ;
  ; .NET's RegistryKey has no length limit, so the whole read-modify-write
  ; runs in PowerShell. DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames keeps `%VAR%` entries
  ; literal so they are written back unexpanded, -Type ExpandString preserves
  ; REG_EXPAND_SZ, and -notcontains is a literal case-insensitive element
  ; compare so reinstalls don't pile up dupes and a `[` in a path can't be
  ; read as a wildcard. Set-ItemProperty creates the value when absent.
  ;
  ; $INSTDIR travels in an env var rather than being interpolated into the
  ; script text: the directory page lets the user pick a path containing an
  ; apostrophe, which would otherwise break the PowerShell string literal.
  ;
  ; powershell.exe is invoked by absolute path, not resolved through PATH -
  ; PATH is the one thing this block cannot assume is sane, and an absolute
  ; path also removes the "rogue powershell.exe earlier in PATH" hijack from a
  ; signed installer. $SYSDIR is WOW64-redirected to SysWOW64 for the 32-bit
  ; NSIS stub, which carries its own copy. No -ExecutionPolicy: it governs
  ; script FILES, not -Command (verified under both Restricted and AllSigned),
  ; and `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in an installer is a stock AV heuristic.
  ; ErrorActionPreference Stop means any failure exits non-zero having written
  ; nothing - TEDI not being on PATH beats corrupting it - and -NonInteractive
  ; keeps an unattended auto-update from ever blocking on a prompt.
  ;
  ; `exit 3` marks "PATH actually changed" so the broadcast below stays
  ; conditional; auto-update re-runs this hook on every release and
  ; HWND_BROADCAST blocks on each unresponsive top-level window.
