/**
 * Shared hover / open / active styling for the top toolbar icon buttons
 * (Header, inline Search, SSH menu) so every one of
 * them picks up the active theme's `--accent` identically.
 *
 * Why this exists: these buttons are shadcn `<Button variant="ghost">`, and the
 * ghost variant ships `dark:hover:bg-muted/50` + `dark:aria-expanded:bg-muted/50`.
 * `tailwind-merge` keys conflicts by the *full* modifier set, so a bare
 * `hover:bg-accent` never strips the `dark:hover:` one - in dark mode the
 * intended accent hover silently lost to a dull muted gray. Spelling out the
 * `dark:` variants here makes the accent state win in BOTH light and dark, and
 * keeps every toolbar button in lockstep (import the constant, never re-type the
 * string). Raw `<button>` toolbar controls (WindowControls) don't carry the
 * ghost variant and so don't need this.

 *
 * The red never changes shade - hover only lays down a faint destructive wash.
 *
 * BOTH colour rules are important (`!`), and the glyph needs its own: these
 * buttons sit inside rows that repaint every descendant on hover, such as a
 * `DropdownMenuItem`'s `focus:**:text-accent-foreground` (the delete-branch and
 * delete-host rows) or a sidebar row's `hover:text-accent-foreground`. Those
 * rules paint the SVG element itself at a specificity a plain
 * `hover:text-destructive` cannot beat, so making only the button red leaves the
 * glyph turning grey the moment the pointer enters the row. Importance beats
 * specificity, which is what lets a nested delete button opt out of its row.
 *
 * Import it; never re-type the string.
