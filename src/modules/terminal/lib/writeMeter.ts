/**
 * Flow control for the xterm write path.

 * xterm drains its write buffer through a nested `setTimeout`, and Chromium
 * throttles those to one per second — one per MINUTE past five minutes — once
 * the page is hidden. Chromium's occlusion tracker marks every window occluded
 * while the Windows session is locked, so a lock screen hits exactly that path.
 * Script execution is NOT throttled, so the PTY keeps pushing at full rate
 * through the Tauri channel while the parser is effectively stopped: the
 * backlog grows unbounded behind the lock screen (hundreds of MB of retained
 * chunks), `Terminal.write` eventually throws at its own 50 MB ceiling — taking
 * the rest of the data handler with it — and unlocking pays for the whole
 * backlog in one parse storm. That is the "lock the PC, come back, TEDI is
 * frozen" report.
 *
 * Past `WRITE_HIGH_WATER` bytes accepted-but-not-yet-parsed we stop feeding
 * xterm and hold the tail here instead, capped at `STALL_CAP`, resuming once
 * the parser has caught up to `WRITE_LOW_WATER`.
