 * (Unix) resize pulls scrollback back down into the viewport - `ybase--`,
 * which also shifts `buffer.y` - because a Unix pty does not repaint on
 * SIGWINCH. ConPTY DOES repaint its whole viewport, so those pulled-in lines
 * survive wherever the repaint does not cover them and the cursor row moves
 * out from under the shell. Inline TUIs that redraw relative to the cursor -
 * Claude Code and Codex in their default renderers, which never touch the
 * alternate screen - then paint every later frame into the wrong rows. That is
 * the "make the pane bigger and the CLI turns to soup" report. Setting
 * `backend` alone switches xterm to appending blank rows, which is what ConPTY
 * actually does.
 *
 * `buildNumber` gates the other half: reflow stays enabled on ConPTY >= 21376
 * (which emits real wrap markers) and falls back to xterm's legacy
 * last-character wrapping heuristic below it. An unparseable version omits the
 * field rather than passing 0, because a zero build would put a modern ConPTY
 * on the legacy heuristic - worse than not setting `windowsPty` at all.
