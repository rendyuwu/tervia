/**
 * Shape and validation for the `.tervia-ssh` connection backup.
 *
 * An import is a TRUST BOUNDARY: the file came off a USB stick or a chat, and
 * whatever survives this module is written straight into the connections store
 * and later dialled. So every field is re-checked here rather than trusted -
 * a bad port would be sent to `TcpStream::connect`, a bad `proxyJumpId` would
 * make every connect fail with "a jump host in the chain no longer exists",
 * and a non-array `forwards` would bind nothing while looking configured.
 *
 * Kept free of Tauri imports (the `SshConnection` import is type-only, so it
 * is erased at compile time) so `scripts/ssh-backup-verify.ts` can exercise
 * the parser under plain node.
