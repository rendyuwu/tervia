/**
 * Export / import saved SSH connections as a single passphrase-encrypted

 * file on their own - a keychain does not move between machines - which is
 * exactly why this exists and why the file is always encrypted: it carries SSH
 * passwords and private keys, so a plaintext export would be a credential leak
 * the moment it touched Downloads or a synced folder. Sealing happens in the
 * host process (`modules/backup.rs`); `crypto.subtle` is not available to the
