/**
 * Editor-owned diff tint colors.
 *
 * The diff views (Git side-by-side + AI proposed-edit) belong to the EDITOR
 * theme domain, not the app chrome. Their inline added/removed tint follows the
 * selected `editorTheme` rather than the app's custom theme. CodeMirror's
 * `@uiw` themes don't expose a canonical diff green/red, so we map each editor
 * theme to a matched pair and write them to `--tervia-editor-diff-added` /
 * `--tervia-editor-diff-removed`, which the diff panes consume.
 *
 * globals.css defaults these vars to the app `--tervia-diff-*` so the first paint
 * (before this runs) is unchanged; `applyEditorDiffColors` then snaps them to
 * the editor theme's pair.
