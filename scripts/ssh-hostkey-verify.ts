/**
 * Self-check for when an SSH host key is TRUSTED, and for which saved host.
 * Run: `npx tsx scripts/ssh-hostkey-verify.ts`.
 *
 * The bug this exists to prevent, reported twice by users on the same day:
 * "Verify SSH host key" kept coming back for a host they had already trusted.
 * Both reports were the same root cause. Trusting the key was only recorded
 * after a FULLY successful connect, so a rejected password threw the answer
 * away and asked again on the next attempt, and a key accepted during the
 * dialog's Test was gone by the time the connection was saved. `openssh` writes
 * `known_hosts` the moment you answer yes, before any credential is sent, which
 * is the behaviour being matched: verifying the server and proving who you are
 * are two different steps and only the first one is being answered here.
 *
 * So the two things pinned down: the accept hook runs on accept ONLY, and it
 * runs BEFORE the backend is told (a failing IPC must not lose the trust), and
 * a prompt is attributed to the right saved connection, since one connect can
 * be dialling a whole ProxyJump chain and the prompt only names a host.
