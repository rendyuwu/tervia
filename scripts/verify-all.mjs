/**
 * Run every `scripts/*-verify.ts`.
 *
 * Replaces the 1480-character `&&` chain this used to be in package.json, which
 * had two costs: adding a check meant hand-editing a single enormous line (and
 * a typo there silently dropped a script from the suite), and `&&` stopped at
 * the FIRST failure, so one broken check hid the results of the other thirty.
 * Globbing the directory means a new `*-verify.ts` is picked up by existing,
 * and every failure is reported in one run.
 *
 * `node scripts/verify-all.mjs ssh` runs only the scripts whose name contains
 * "ssh" - the whole suite is ~15s, but a single check is ~0.4s while iterating.
