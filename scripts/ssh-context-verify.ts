/**
 * Self-check for `resolveSshContext`, which decides whether Source Control acts
 * on a REMOTE repository or the local one.
 * Run: `npx tsx scripts/ssh-context-verify.ts`.
 *
 * `fromActiveLeaf` is the flag that gates it, and getting it wrong is not
 * cosmetic: the panel stages, commits and DISCARDS against whichever repo it
 * resolved to. The bug this exists to prevent: every tab without leaves
 * (Settings, a git or AI diff, the Source Control tab itself) made
 * `activePaneTab` null, which dropped `fromActiveLeaf` to false and silently
 * moved Source Control from the remote repository the user was working in back
 * to the local one - while the SSH file tree beside it carried on showing the
 * remote. A discard aimed at the remote would have deleted local work.
