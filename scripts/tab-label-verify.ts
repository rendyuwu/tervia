/**
 * Tab / pane / Workspaces-panel label parity. Three properties, all of which
 * fail silently as "the same tab is called two different things in two places":
 *
 * 1. ONE derivation. `leafLabel` is the only place a leaf's name is computed,
 *    and the tab strip (`buildEntries`), the pane header, `tab.title` and the
 *    Workspaces panel all read it. This used to be four separate copies, and a
 *    rename would move the tab strip while the pane header and the workspace
 *    list kept showing the folder basename.
 * 2. A user-set `customTitle` outranks every derived name, on every leaf kind.
 *    An SSH leaf resolves to `ssh:<name>` off the saved connection, falling back
 *    to the host and then to a bare "ssh" - the panel showed a cwd basename here
 *    while the strip showed the host, for the same pane.
 * 3. DEPTH-FIRST ORDER. A workspace never opened this session has no live leaf
 *    ids, so the panel pairs its rows with the persisted OSC titles BY POSITION.
 *    That holds only while `savedToTab` + `buildEntries` emit leaves in the same
 *    depth-first, left-to-right order a plain walk of the snapshot does. Nothing
 *    else pins that down, and a reordering would mislabel every split pane.
 *
 * Run: `npx tsx scripts/tab-label-verify.ts`.
