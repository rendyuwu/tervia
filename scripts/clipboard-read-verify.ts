/**
 * Self-check for the clipboard READ path (`readClipboardText`).
 * Run: `npx tsx scripts/clipboard-read-verify.ts`.
 *
 * Paste was dead on Linux because `navigator.clipboard.readText()` rejects
 * there: wry only enables WebKitGTK's `javascript_can_access_clipboard` (which
 * also flips WebCore's `DOMPasteAllowed`, the read gate) when the webview is
 * built with `clipboard: true`, and Tauri defaults that to false with no
 * tauri.conf.json knob for a config-declared window. Reads therefore go through
 * the `clipboard_read_text` Rust command instead.
 *
 * Nothing else ties that path's three files together - a command name that
 * matches nothing, or a command that is never registered, fails only at runtime
 * and only on a real paste. So:
 *  1. COMMAND NAME: the invoked name is the one Rust exposes.
 *  2. REGISTERED: the command is in `generate_handler!`, and reads do not depend
 *     on the webview clipboard flag Tauri leaves off.
 *  3. NO WEBVIEW READS: nothing in src/ reads the clipboard via `navigator`
 *     again (that is the regression that brings the Linux bug back).
 *  4. RESOLVES, NEVER REJECTS: a failed read yields "" so paste sites need no
 *     per-site catch (an empty/image-only clipboard is not an error).
