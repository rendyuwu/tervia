/**
 * Workspace serialization audit. Five properties, all silent when broken:
 *
 * 1. A remote (SFTP) editor leaf must never round-trip through its SESSION.
 *    `sshSessionId` is a live russh number: dead after a restart, and since the
 *    counter restarts at 1, liable to name a different host. Restoring a leaf
 *    that keeps it is wrong; restoring one WITHOUT anything remote is worse,
 *    because `useDocument` then reads - and on the next save writes - the
 *    remote path against the LOCAL disk.
 * 2. A leaf carrying a saved `sshConnectionId` must round-trip, since that id
 *    survives a restart and the pane re-resolves it to a live session. An
 *    AD-HOC one (no profile) has nothing to come back as and is still pruned;
 *    its siblings, the split shape, and the active-leaf index have to survive
 *    that prune.
 * 3. `savedActiveTabIndex` must count exactly the tabs `serializeTabs` emits.
 *    Any drift silently focuses the wrong tab on restore.
 * 4. A tab renamed from its right-click menu must round-trip. The serializer
 *    whitelists leaf fields one by one, so a new one is dropped unless it is
 *    added in BOTH directions - and the failure is a name that quietly reverts
 *    to the folder basename on the next launch. Clearing a name must remove the
 *    key rather than persist `""`, which would restore as a blank tab.
 * 5. An RDP leaf must round-trip its connection id AND its size mode, and must
 *    restore with NO session identity of any kind. The id is the only thing
 *    that can find the host, the credentials and the desktop size again, and a
 *    leaf that loses it comes back as a pane that can never connect; the size
 *    mode is persisted from day one purely so adding `"fit"` later needs no
 *    migration, which is worthless if the serializer drops it. Together these
 *    are property 4's whitelist problem on a kind where the symptom is a dead
 *    pane rather than a wrong name.
 *
 * Run: `npx tsx scripts/workspace-serialize-verify.ts`.
 *
 * serialize.ts pulls in panes.ts (type-only imports) and the zustand title
 * store, so this runs under plain node with hand-built pane trees.
